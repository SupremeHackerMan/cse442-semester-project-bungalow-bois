Javascript can change HTML contents and elements by utilizing methods and scripts. With HTML, websites will properly display data depending on the styling provided by the Javascript code in CSS.
While, Javascript is far from the most efficient and effective programming language to be used, it gets the job done for websites.
Javascript data types (or variables) are:
Numbers
Strings
Objects
Arrays
Functions
